911 Calls in Seattle Throughout 2015
====================================
An Interactive web application whose purpose is to display and better understand all the 911 Calls made in the Seattle area in the year 2015. The contributors include Cole Cansler, Brendan Long, Chris Graham and Drew McCoy.

The Data
--------
The data we are using is from the *data.seattle.gov* website and can be found [here](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Police-Department-911-Incident-Response/3k2p-39jp). We decided to use data from the year 2015 in order to focus our analysis. Prior to beginning the project we had to go through the data and remove any row values. In addition we deleted columns there were not pertinent to our analysis.

Goals
-----
The purpose of our project was to build a easy to use web application that both city officals, and its citizens could use and gain valuable information from. A few of the questions about the data set that we wanted to provide answers to are, where are 911 calls coming from, what types of calls are being made, and how are the rate of calls changing over time. We decided to make a tabbed structure, with each tab providing an answer to one of these questions.
